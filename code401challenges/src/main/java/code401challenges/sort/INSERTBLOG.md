# INSERT SORT
Insert sort is a sorting algorithm that sorts the array one item at a time.  It is less efficient for larger data sets however it is beneficial for smaller data sets because of its easy implementation.

## Informative Flow
* PROS
    * Easily implemented
    * Efficient for small datasets
    * Efficient for datasets that are mostly sorted
    * In place so it requires O(1) memory space
* CONS
    * Larger datasets are slower
    * Worst case scenario requires a lot of element shifts
## Diagram

## Algorithm
* Insertion Sort works by iterating over an array taking an element out of the data set and inserting it where it belongs.  It continues this process until all elements are in their correct place.  Insertion sort is typically done in place.
