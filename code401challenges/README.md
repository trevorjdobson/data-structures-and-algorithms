# Reverse an Array
First code challange working with arrays.

## Challenge
Write a function that takes in an array of integeres and reverses the array.

## Approach & Efficiency
I decided to use a for loop to swap the elements of the array in place.  I used the halfway point of the array as my stopping point for the for loop.

# Reverse an Array
Second code challenge working with arrays

## Challenge
Write a function that takes in an array of integers and an interger and inserts that integer in the middle of the array.

## Approach & Efficiency
I first made a new array with the length being 1 more than the input array.  I then found the midpoint of that array.  I then looped through the new array inserting elements in their proper locations.
