# Reverse an Array
First code challange working with arrays.

## Challenge
Write a function that takes in an array of integeres and reverses the array.

## Approach & Efficiency
I decided to use a for loop to swap the elements of the array in place.  I used the halfway point of the array as my stopping point for the for loop.
